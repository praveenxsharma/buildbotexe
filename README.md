## ✨ Key Features

This repository utilizes a robust Python-based pipeline to ensure high reliability and optimization.

* **Fully Automated:** GitHub Actions workflow executes daily at 06:00 UTC, requiring zero manual intervention.
* **Architecture Optimization:** Builds specific `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, and `universal` APKs to reduce file size and improve performance on target devices.
* **Multi-Source Strategy:** Intelligent fetching from APKMirror, APKPure, and Uptodown ensures high success rates even if one source is down.
* **Granular Patch Control:** Simple text-based configuration allows for precise inclusion or exclusion of specific patches.
* **Smart Failover:** The system automatically switches download sources if a fetch attempt fails.
* **Auto-Signing:** All APKs are signed with a consistent public keystore, making them ready to install immediately.
* **Clean Release Cycle:** Previous releases are replaced rather than archived, preventing clutter and making it easy for external managers (like Orion) to track updates.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

This builder is highly configurable. You can adjust the following files to customize the build output.

### 1. App Selection (`patch-config.json`)

Define which applications the pipeline should attempt to build.

```json
{
  "patch_list": [
    { "app_name": "youtube", "source": "morphe" },
    { "app_name": "youtube-music", "source": "morphe" },
    { "app_name": "X", "source": "crimera" }
  ]
}

```

### 2. Architecture Matrix (`arch-config.json`)

Specify which CPU architectures to target for each application.

```json
[
  {
    "app_name": "youtube",
    "source": "morphe",
    "arches": ["arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a", "universal"]
  },
  {
    "app_name": "youtube-music",
    "source": "morphe",
    "arches": ["arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a"]
  }
]

```

### 3. Source Definitions

Located in the `apps/` directory. Example for `apps/apkmirror/youtube.json`:

```json
{
  "org": "google-inc",
  "name": "youtube",
  "type": "APK",
  "arch": "universal",
  "dpi": "nodpi",
  "package": "com.google.android.youtube",
  "version": ""
}

```

### 4. Patch Rules

Located in `patches/`. Example for `patches/youtube-morphe.txt`. Use `+` to force include and `-` to exclude.

```text
# Essential patches
+ microg-support
+ premium-heading
+ hide-infocard-suggestions

# Exclusions
- custom-branding
- amoled

```
